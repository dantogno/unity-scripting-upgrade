# Unity Scripting Upgrade

## Introduction

C# and .NET, the technologies underlying Unity scripting, have continued to receive updates since Microsoft originally released them in 2002. But Unity developers may not be aware of the steady stream of new features added to the C# language and .NET Framework. That's because prior to the release of Unity 2017.1, Unity has been using a .NET 3.5 equivalent scripting runtime, missing over 10 years of updates!

With the release of Unity 2017.1, Unity introduced an experimental version of its core scripting runtime upgraded to a .NET 4.6 compatible version. In Unity 2018.1, the .NET 4.x equivalent runtime is no longer considered "experimental" and has been rebranded as "stable," while the older .NET 2 equivalent runtime is now considered "legacy." Unity is projecting to make the upgraded scripting runtime the default selection in Unity 2018.3.
