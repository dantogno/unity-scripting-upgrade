# Unity Scripting Upgrade

With the release of Unity 2017.1, Unity introduced an experimental version of its core scripting runtime upgraded to Mono/.NET 4.6 runtime. In Unity 2018.1, the .NET 4 equivalent runtime is no longer considered "experimental." Unity is projecting to make the upgraded scripting runtime the default selection in Unity 2018.3.
